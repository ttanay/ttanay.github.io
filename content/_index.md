Hi, I'm Tanay. Some people call me TT.

I currently work as a freelance Software Engineer.

I like building software for Data, Infrastructure, and Tooling.

I'm also interested in Music, Films, Math, and Comedy.

I make music sometimes at [@bagaichi](https://soundcloud.com/bagaichi).

I used to write about the Independent music scene in Delhi at [The Groovy Train](https://thegroovytrain.wordpress.com/blog/).
