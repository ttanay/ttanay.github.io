      <description>The windowFunnel function in ClickHouse has proved useful many times for me. I wondered how it actually works. I try to explain the algorithm it uses as well as why it works.&#xA;Background Funnels[1] are a type of visualization that track how many users progress through a set of steps. They are used to model customer journeys in different contexts like product, marketing, etc. Each step is visualized as a stage of a narrowing funnel.</description>

      <title>Arriving at Kadane&#39;s algorithm</title>

      <description>I found the explanation of Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm on Wikipedia[1] too dense for a normie like me. So, I asked myself, if the algorithm were to be lost to the sands of time, how would I arrive at it naturally?&#xA;Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm is a solution to the maximum subarray problem.&#xA;What is the maximum subarray problem? We take help from Wikipedia here.&#xA;In computer science, the maximum sum subarray problem, also known as the maximum segment sum problem, is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1&amp;hellip;n] of numbers.</description>

      <title>Proof for height of a binary tree</title>

      <description>I keep forgetting the standard result of the height of a binary tree. I figured, writing out the proof on my own might help me remember the result.&#xA;We assume that the tree is a full binary tree for simplicity. A full binary tree is defined as follows[1]:&#xA;A binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.&#xA;A binary tree starts with the root node at level one(we consider levels to be 1-indexed).</description>

      <description>ClickHouse is easily one of the fastest OLAP databases on the face of this planet. I have had the fortune of working on it at different stints. This is my attempt to best summarize my understanding of it.&#xA;This post is latest as on 835afe1f342.&#xA;Introduction ClickHouse is a columnar, vectorized OLAP database written in C++. We will take an example read query, and look at how the query is processed.</description>
